        >&nbsp;IKIBID 15 is a water world, its surface completely covered by
        vast, deep oceans. The planet&rsquo;s geology is primarily shaped by its
        active tectonic and geothermal processes beneath the ocean floor. With
        no landmasses above the water, all of IKIBID 15&rsquo;s geological
        activity occurs below the surface, from deep ocean trenches to towering
        underwater volcanoes. The planet&rsquo;s active tectonic plates create a
        highly dynamic environment where the seafloor is constantly reshaped by
        volcanic activity and plate movements.</span

        those of Earth&apos;s, with some trenches extending tens of kilometers
        below the surface. These oceanic trenches are formed by tectonic
        subduction zones, where plates collide and one sinks beneath the other
        into the planet&rsquo;s mantle. The immense pressures at these depths
        create extreme environments, inhospitable to most life forms, but rich
        in geological phenomena such as the formation of deep-sea mineral
        deposits and hydrothermal vent systems.</span

        >In October 2024 an international research effort led by NASA under the
        name AMG 15 announced it had directly detected water composition for the
        first time above IKIBID 15&rsquo;s surface. If plumes from volcanoes do
        exist, and if their source is the same as Europa&rsquo;s ocean, then a
        spacecraft could travel through the plume to sample and analyze it from
        orbit, and it would essentially be analyzing the planet&rsquo;s ocean.
        NASA&rsquo;s spacecraft had performed a similar feat on Saturn&rsquo;s
        moon Enceladus, which is known to have an ocean spraying water into
        space, this expedition mission would be performed in the near
        future.</span

        >&nbsp;The planet is located relatively close to the other star systems.
        The TEL-10T System consists of a single G-type main-sequence star,
        emitting a steady stream of radiation and warmth typical of a yellow
        Star. IKIBID 15, the only planet in this system, orbits its star at a
        significant distance of approximately 3,2 AU, placing it at the outer
        edge of the star&rsquo;s habitable zone. Despite the star&rsquo;s
        moderate luminosity, IKIBID 15&rsquo;s atmosphere is only half as dense
        as Earth&rsquo;s, resulting in minimal heat retention and almost no
        sunlight reaching the planet&rsquo;s surface. This low atmospheric
        density, combined with a thick cloud layer, creates a perpetually dim
        and cold environment where surface temperatures remain largely regulated
        by geothermal and chemical processes. Due to the absence of other
        planets or moons in the system, IKIBID 15 follows a stable, undisturbed
        orbit, allowing life to evolve in unique isolation. Organisms on the
        planet have adapted to the scarcity of sunlight by relying on
        chemosynthesis, extracting energy from geothermal sources rather than
        solar input. The G-type star, while more luminous than a red dwarf,
        provides little direct influence on the planet&rsquo;s surface
        conditions, as the distance and atmospheric composition block much of
        its radiation. The stability of the star ensures that IKIBID 15&rsquo;s
        chemosynthesis-driven ecosystem can thrive for billions of years with
        minimal stellar disruptions.</span

    <h3>lifeforms:</h3>
    <p>
      All lifeforms evolve to survive within the high pressures of water and
      minimum light, which are called extremophilic. They donâ€™t have eyes
      because of the minimum light; they also interact or move slowly due to low
      energy. Because no light is coming to this planet, they will rely on the
      heat source from the core and chemosynthesis organisms. At hydrothermal
      vents that line the planetâ€™s volcanic craters and oceanic trenches.
      microorganisms use energy from chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide and
      methane, released by the planetâ€™s tectonic activity, to produce organic
      compounds. This process forms the base of the food web, supporting an
      array of unique species. These organisms have developed behaviors finely
      tuned to the erratic bursts of chemical emissions from the vents.
